Data and code for "Coupling of Coastal Activity with Tidal Cycles is Stronger in Tool-using Capuchins (<i>Cebus capucinus imitator</i>)" by ZoÃ« Goldsborough, Margaret Crofoot, Shauhin Alavi, Sylvia Garza, Evelyn Del Rosario-Vargas, Kate Tiedeman, Claudio Monteza-Moreno, and Brendan Barrett (2023).

This repository contains the R script ("tooltides.R") required to run the main analyses reported in the manuscript, and our dataset ("tooltides.csv"), consisting of cleaned annotations of camera trap data, which have been aggregated to the sequence-level. Two additional scripts, one R script ("dist2coast.R") and one Google Earth Engine script ("distcoast_ee.txt") show how we calculated the distance to the coastal vegetation line for each camera trap.
